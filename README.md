# hough-line-detection-fast
 This project was developed as part of an undergraduate Computer Vision course to implement line detection using the Hough Transform from scratch. The key highlight of this implementation is its fully vectorized approach, ensuring high computational efficiency and significantly faster performance compared to traditional methods.  Hope this helps somebody.
